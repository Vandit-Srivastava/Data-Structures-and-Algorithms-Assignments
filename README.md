# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Assignments
I have uploaded the python code for 5 projects that I did in my 2022 spring semester under the course, "DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM' at IIT-Delhi.

1)Used Stacks to create a program that takes a drone command P(string) as input and outputs the final position of the drone after it has executed its command P and the total distance travelled by the drone in this process. O(n) time

2)Used Minheaps to create a program to list collisions in chronological order that occur within a set of 'n' point objects located in a gravity-free one-dimensional universe with inital velocities and positions and masses given. O(n + m log n) time

3)Implemented a 2D-range tree on a set of n data points to find all points within given range of distance from a central point. Returned all k values in O(k + log2n) time for Google and similar Search Engine applications.

4)Modified Rabin-Karp Algorithm for pattern matching in text using hashing to reduce time and space used to O((m+n)logq) and O(k+logn+logq) respectively, where n, k, q are size of text, number of matches and size of prime used for modulo in hash function. Controlled probability of false match (Îµ) by computing N, the upper limit on q using probability and number theory. Accounted for wildcard characters in pattern for application in text editors/viewers.

5)Modified Dijkstra Algorithm to find largest packet size transferable between 2 nodes in a network with m router links of varying capacities. Returned such a router path in O(mlogm) time using graph and max-heap data structures.
